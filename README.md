# SNHU-CS230--Operating-Platforms

This project was done for a "company" called The Gaming Room. They enlisted our services to create a game called Draw It or List It.
This was originally a web-based game that eventually expanded to multiple platforms. I felt that I had a strong description of the 
domain model and within my recommendations, the security portion is was well thought out based on selecting Linux as the base kernel. 
Workign through a design document like this assisted in many ways to develop the code for the project. It definitely allowed me to 
put all of my thoughts onto paper and guided me through the technical process. The domain model specifically is the most helpful. 
The one place I would like to improve would be my evaluation section. Although I gave the required answers, I feel I could have been more descriptive.
I also could have added additional details, such as cost, to give the company more to look at and aide in them making decisions for their application.
User's needs are important to consider in designing a document because it's their product. You need to make sure that the user who is hiring you
gets what they are looking for. If there is something that genuinely can't be done then discussions need to be had with the client. All of these things 
should be flushed out in the first initial meetings between the two groups.
